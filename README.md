# **Introduction to Computer Vision and Image-Processing**

**Computer Vision (CV)**

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand images and videos. It allows machines to recognize objects, people, and patterns, simulating human visual abilities. CV is essential for applications like facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous driving.

**Image Processing**

Image Processing is the first step in preparing visual data for CV. It involves converting images into a digital format and applying techniques to improve their quality, enhance features, and extract useful information. This step is crucial for ensuring that the images fed into CV systems are clear and informative.

**Importance for AI Systems**

For AI systems to function effectively, they must handle and analyze images accurately. Image processing helps by enhancing and cleaning up visual data, which allows CV models to recognize patterns and make precise decisions. Proper image processing ensures that AI systems can interpret visual information correctly and perform tasks reliably.


# **Types of Image Processing Techniques**

Image processing involves enhancing and manipulating images to achieve various results. It can improve image quality, remove unwanted objects, or even create entirely new images. For example, image processing can be used to remove the background from a photo, leaving only the main subject.

This field includes a range of techniques and algorithms designed to perform different tasks. This section will cover some common image processing tasks and how they are performed.

**1. Image Restoration**

Images can degrade over time, especially older ones from before cloud storage was common. For example, photos from old instant cameras may get scratched. Image Restoration is an important technique used to fix these damaged images. Advanced methods, including Deep Learning, can help recover missing parts of old or torn documents, revealing information that was lost.

The example below shows an old photo that, with the help of image restoration, has been restored to its original appearance.

**2. Object Detection**

Object Detection involves finding and identifying objects in an image. Itâ€™s commonly used in security and surveillance. The most common method uses Deep Learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect objects accurately.

The example below shows how object detection is used in highway security cameras to identify and monitor vehicles.

**3. Image-to-Image Translation**

Image-to-Image Translation involves learning how to transform one type of image into another. For example, you can input a free-hand sketch and get a realistic image of the object from that sketch. This is done by training a model with pairs of related images as shown below.
